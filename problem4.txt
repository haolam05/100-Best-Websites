*** Examine the gnuplot file produce-scatterplot.gnuplot. Ignoring the first line, explain what the rest of the script does.

set xlabel "Rank"					-	label the x-axis "Rank"
set ylabel "Size"					-	label the y-axis "Size (Bytes)"
set xrange [0:100]					-	set the range of the x-axis to go from 0 to 100
set output "scatterplot.eps"				-	save the result in the file called "scatterplot.eps"
plot "results.txt", using 1:3 title "" with points	-	plot the "results.txt" file, column 1 stores x-axis values(rank) and column 3 stores y-axis values(size in bytes)
								=> column2 is ignored simply because it stores the urls

*** Looking at the scatterplot, what can you conclude about the relationship between the popularity of a site and the size of its index.html file? Are these result what you expected?

First of all, here are what we know:
	- the sites on the left are more popular than the sites on the right. Why? Because when parsing, I preserve the ranking order from the "100 Best Websites List" table in popular.html.
	- the sites on the top has heavier index.html file compared to the sites at the bottom

Looking at the scatterplot and using the information that we know, I can conclude the popularity of a site is directly proportionaly with its index.html file size.
Although a site can be popular with a large index.html file size, the sites that have smaller size of index.html file seem to have higher probability to be more popular.

Argument
	- looking at the top 20 most popular website(0 <= x <= 20), we can tell that most sites have size smaller than 500,000 bytes for their index.html file.
	- on the other hand, quadrant 20 - 40, 40 - 60, 60 - 80, and 80 - 100, tell us that smaller websites are favorable

Expectation
	- Yes, these result is what I expected from the beginning. It makes sense because the index.html file is where a viewer first landed when they visit the site(like the root page).
	Thus, the larger the index.html size is, the more loads on the servers, the higher chance the a server will go down. If a server is down, then availability decreases, thus, less customers can be served.
	So, even if the site is truly popular, if it can't be visited. Moreover, having a heavy index.html page increases maintenance costs, required more/stronger servers,
	losts of business opportunities, so it makes sense that	most sites decided to have a smaller root page.
